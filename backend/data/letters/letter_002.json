Your pre-operative imaging showed severe stenosis in the right SFA mid-segment, with an 85% occlusion. The lesion length was 12 cm, and the vessel diameter was 5.2 mm.\n\nThe procedure was performed via the right common femoral artery, targeting the right superficial femoral artery. The planned intervention was a balloon angioplasty with provisional stenting. The devices used included a 6mm x 120mm drug-coated balloon, a 0.018\" hydrophilic wire, and a 6Fr arterial sheath.\n\nThe transcription from the surgery did not provide any significant findings or observations. Your intraoperative vitals were stable, with a blood pressure of 142/88, heart rate of 78, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The contrast used was within the acceptable range, and the fluoroscopy time was 12.5 minutes.\n\nPost-operatively, you were stable and recovering as expected. There were no immediate complications noted. \n\nFor follow-up care, it is recommended that you continue your current medications, including Clopidogrel 75mg daily, Aspirin 81mg daily, Atorvastatin 40mg daily, and Metformin 1000mg BID. Please continue to monitor for any signs of infection or complications, such as increased pain, swelling, redness, or drainage at the procedure site. \n\nPlease schedule a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks to assess your recovery and discuss any concerns or questions you may have. \n\nThank you for entrusting us with your care. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact our office.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]\n[Your Title]\n",
