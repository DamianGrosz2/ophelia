The procedure, an Endovascular PAD Angioplasty, was performed on January 10, 2025, by Dr. Sarah Chen in operating room OR-C3.\n\nMr. Martinez has a significant medical history including a previous left SFA angioplasty in 2023, well-controlled type 2 diabetes, and is a former smoker. His comorbidities include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD). His recent labs were within normal limits, and his medications include Clopidogrel, Aspirin, Atorvastatin, and Metformin.\n\nThe procedure was planned due to severe stenosis in the right superficial femoral artery (SFA) with 85% occlusion, as identified by a CT angiography performed on January 5, 2025. The access site for the procedure was the right common femoral artery, and the planned intervention was a balloon angioplasty with provisional stenting. The device selection included a 6mm x 120mm drug-coated balloon, a 0.018\" hydrophilic wire, and a 6Fr arterial sheath.\n\nIntraoperative vitals were stable with a blood pressure of 142/88, heart rate of 78, and oxygen saturation of 98%. A total of 45ml of contrast was used, well within the maximum limit of 75ml. The fluoroscopy time was 12.5 minutes, and the radiation dose was 245 mGy.\n\nPostoperatively, Mr. Martinez is in stable condition. He tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications. He will be closely monitored for any potential adverse reactions, particularly given his allergy to iodine contrast, which has previously caused a rash.\n\nFor follow-up care, Mr. Martinez is advised to continue his current medications and to attend regular follow-up appointments to monitor his condition. It is also recommended that he maintain a healthy lifestyle to manage his diabetes and cardiovascular health.\n\nThank you for your continued collaboration in the care of Mr. Martinez. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or need further information.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDr. Sarah Chen\n[Your Hospital's Name]\n[Your Contact Information]",
