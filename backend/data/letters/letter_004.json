The procedure was performed by Dr. Sarah Chen in Operating Room OR-C3 using a Mobile C-arm Siemens Cios Alpha. \n\nThe procedure was planned due to severe stenosis in the right superficial femoral artery (SFA) mid-segment, with an 85% occlusion, as revealed by a CT angiography performed on January 5, 2025. The planned intervention was a balloon angioplasty with provisional stenting, accessed via the right common femoral artery. \n\nIntraoperatively, Mr. Martinez remained stable with a blood pressure of 142/88 mmHg, heart rate of 78 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 98%. A total of 45 ml of contrast was used, well below the maximum limit of 75 ml. The fluoroscopy time was 12.5 minutes with a total radiation dose of 245 mGy.\n\nPostoperatively, Mr. Martinez has been stable and recovering as expected. There were no complications during the procedure and his vital signs remained within normal limits.\n\nFor follow-up care, I recommend regular monitoring of Mr. Martinez's PAD symptoms and a repeat angiogram in 6 months to assess the patency of the treated vessel. He should continue his current medications including clopidogrel, aspirin, atorvastatin, and metformin. Given his allergy to iodine contrast, alternative contrast agents should be considered for future imaging studies.\n\nThank you for your continued collaboration in the care of Mr. Martinez. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or require additional information.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]\n[Your Title]\n[Your Contact Information]",
