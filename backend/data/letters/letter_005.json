The procedure was an Endovascular PAD Angioplasty, which was conducted on January 10, 2025, in OR-C3, utilizing the Mobile C-arm Siemens Cios Alpha.\n\nMr. Martinez, a 68-year-old male with a BMI of 28.5, has a medical history significant for peripheral arterial disease (PAD), previous left SFA angioplasty in 2023, well-controlled type 2 diabetes, and is a former smoker. His comorbidities include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD). \n\nThe angioplasty was necessitated due to severe stenosis in the right SFA mid-segment, with 85% occlusion. The procedure was performed via access to the right common femoral artery, targeting the right superficial femoral artery. The planned intervention was a balloon angioplasty with provisional stenting, utilizing a 6mm x 120mm drug-coated balloon, a 0.018\" hydrophilic wire, and a 6Fr arterial sheath.\n\nIntraoperatively, Mr. Martinez's vitals were stable, with a blood pressure of 142/88, heart rate of 78, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The total contrast used was 45ml, well within the maximum limit of 75ml. The fluoroscopy time was 12.5 minutes, and the radiation dose was 245 mGy.\n\nPost-operatively, Mr. Martinez is in stable condition. His labs, including creatinine, platelets, INR, and hemoglobin, are within normal limits. He is currently on Clopidogrel 75mg daily, Aspirin 81mg daily, Atorvastatin 40mg daily, and Metformin 1000mg BID. \n\nFor follow-up care, I recommend a routine check-up in two weeks to monitor his recovery. In addition, given his allergy to iodine contrast and penicillin, care should be taken during future procedures to avoid these substances.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or require additional information.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDr. Sarah Chen\n[Your Title]\n[Your Contact Information]",
