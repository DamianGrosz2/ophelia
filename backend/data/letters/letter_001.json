The procedure was performed by Dr. Sarah Chen using the Mobile C-arm Siemens Cios Alpha. The procedure was planned due to severe stenosis in the right superficial femoral artery (SFA) with 85% occlusion, as revealed by a CT angiography performed on January 5, 2025. \n\nThe procedure was performed via access to the right common femoral artery. The planned intervention was a balloon angioplasty with provisional stenting. The device selection included a 6mm x 120mm drug-coated balloon, a 0.018\" hydrophilic wire, and a 6Fr arterial sheath. \n\nIntraoperatively, Mr. Martinez remained stable with vitals of blood pressure 142/88, heart rate 78, and oxygen saturation 98%. A total of 45 ml of contrast was used, well within the maximum limit of 75 ml. The fluoroscopy time was 12.5 minutes with a radiation dose of 245 mGy.\n\nPostoperatively, Mr. Martinez is in stable condition. He will continue on his current medications, which include Clopidogrel 75mg daily, Aspirin 81mg daily, Atorvastatin 40mg daily, and Metformin 1000mg BID. \n\nFor follow-up care, I recommend close monitoring of Mr. Martinez's symptoms and ABI. Repeat imaging studies may be necessary to assess the patency of the treated vessel. Please also continue managing his comorbid conditions and medications as per current guidelines.\n\nThank you for your continued collaboration in the care of Mr. Martinez. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or require additional information.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDr. Sarah Chen\n[Contact Information]",
